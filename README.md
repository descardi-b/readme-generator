# readme-generator

🌸 hey there! 🌸

welcome to the readme generator app, a seamless way of dynamically created readme files through the backend. 

as part of creating this app for the uc berkeley coding bootcamp, i was responsible for:

🍓 creating unique and separately concerned javascript files for framework <br />
🍓 utilizing node.js to initialize the backend <br />
🍓 establishing functions from the ground up to dynamically transform user input into a readme file <br />

here's a link to a video demonstrating my work: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gSCDfn1aFIiZpdCQqG-N0Z_U3b7U8Xh2/view">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gSCDfn1aFIiZpdCQqG-N0Z_U3b7U8Xh2/view</a>
